### General
A basic RPG style fighting game with characters representing different styles of martial arts.  There are four characters in total.  Characters can be chosen by a single click on their card.  First select the player's character then select the CPU's character.  The battle opens when the Fight button is clicked.

To play, simply click the Attack button.  Both characters will attack each other and the results are displayed in the fight scene cards.  The first character to reach 0 health loses.  If the player wins, another character can be selected.  The Fight button must be clicked to open the battle.  Before the Fight button is clicked, the CPU character can be changed.  The Try Again button will reset the game and will only display when the game is over.

Every time the player attacks an opponent, the attack strength is increased.  The CPU attack strength remains constant.

Each character has their own background.
